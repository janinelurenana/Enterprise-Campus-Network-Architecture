# Verification of v3 – Service Isolation & Segmentation

This folder documents verification of the v3 network configuration, focusing on **DMZ web services** and **HR file server access**. Screenshots and evidence demonstrate that:

* DMZ is properly isolated
* Public services are accessible as intended
* Internal sensitive assets (HR file server) are protected from unauthorized access
* Firewall policies and VLAN segmentation enforce intended security posture

All screenshots and supporting files are in the `screenshots/` folder.
